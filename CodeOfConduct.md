Schmidty's Code of Conduct
==========================
This Code of Conduct describes the behavior standards expected of contributors and other
participants in the `doczar` open source software project.

1. Community Conduct
--------------------
You have the right to express any opinion. You have the right to respond to any opinion in any way.
You have the right to publish any statement which meets all of the following qualifications:
 * The statement is directly relevant to the `doczar` project.
 * The statement is not calculated to disrupt normal conversation or trigger off-topic controversy.
 * The statement is not in violation of the laws of the United States of the America.
 * The statement contains no assertion, true or false, of real world information related to another
    person, living or dead, which is not readily available from free public sources.

You have every right to disagree with this Code of Conduct. You may advocate for its change and you
may advocate behavior which violates it as long as you do not participate in a way which violates
the concurrent text of the Code of Conduct.

2. Community Standards
----------------------
Material contributions to the `doczar` project will be judged only by the fitness for purpose of the
contributed material. Officially sanctioned maintainers of the project are obligated to refrain from
participating in off-topic conversations. This project will not reject any functionally adequate
contribution on the basis of statements made by the contributing party not directly relating to the
`doczar` project. Contributions from active detractors of the project itself may be rejected out of
pure paranoid fear that the contribution may contain disguised intentional flaws.


3. Statement of Agenda
----------------------
The maintainers reject the philosophy that anyone should be protected from hearing the opinions of
anyone else. It is our avowed position that preventing the discussion of divisive opinions serves no
ultimate purpose except to shield such opinions from criticism. We believe in open discussion, not
forcedly pleasant discussion.

At the same time, we assert that the `doczar` project is not an appropriate forum for the discussion
of anything whatsoever except for relevant engineering issues. A modest effort will be made to
moderate or eliminate all disruptive conversation which does not advance project goals.
