doczar
======
Doczar (pronounced **d≈çzer**) is a simple, explicit documentation generator for javascript, python,
ruby, java, c-like languages, and others. It is used to generate [its own docs.]
(http://shenanigans.github.io/node-doczar/docs/module/doczar/index.html)

`doczar` has one significant conceptual difference from most documentation generation tools: your
project is always presented as being part of a global namespace. Because `doczar` aspires to be
language agnostic, the built-in primitives of your environment (i.e. `Object` or `int`) are treated
no differently than the types you write yourself.

The benefits of this scheme are accessed via the `--with` command line option. A selection of
[very simple libraries](https://github.com/shenanigans/node-doczar/tree/master/standardLibs) loads
remote URLs documenting environment primitives. These types will then be crosslinked wherever they
appear in your documentation. You can easily document large projects, multiple projects, or even
everything you're working on all at once within the same namespace. When you view this
documentation, you will also have instant access to the standard library documentation. In rapidly
upcoming features, the documentation for your external dependencies will be included automatically
as well.

The second goal of `doczar` is to create a single comment dialect which documents a large subset of
all programming languages. There are facilities for keyword arguments and argument defaults,
multiple return values, pointers, generics and interfaces. The `@module` tag can adequately describe
a Node.js module, a C++ namespace or a Java package.

In early days, `doczar` focused entirely on manual tag authoring with a focus on an easy-to-type
syntax to lighten the extra burden. As syntax support matures and expands to more platforms,
intuitive support for explicit expressions will remain a priority. In a nutshell: `doczar` may
involve slightly more typing than a javadoc-derived sollution, but you should never find it
difficult to explain what you mean when the parser isn't following you.

The `doczar` comment syntax allows manual documentation of source in C/C++/C#, Java, Javascript,
Python, Go, php, css and html. Library support is currently only available for Javascript es5, es6
and the browser environment with or without strict mode. If you are interested in contributing,
authoring a standard lib file is a great way to start! Code parsing support is currently only
available for es5 browser and node-like environments, with es6 support coming very soon. The next
action items are to support javadoc comment syntax and expand code parsing support to python and
java.

Installation
------------
`doczar` is a cross-platform application based on [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/). You will need
to have it on your system.

The preferred installation method is to use `npm` with the global `-g` flag. This will install
`doczar` within your executable path.
```shell
$ sudo npm install -g doczar
$ doczar --with browser
```


Shell Usage
-----------
The default output path is `./docs/`. There is no input default whatsoever.
```shell
$ doczar --in=src/**/*.c --out docz
$ doczar --jsmod ./index
```

option             | description
------------------:|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--o, --out         | Selects a directory to fill with documentation output. The directory need not exist or be empty.
--i, --in          | Selects files to document. Parses nix-like wildcards using [glob](https://github.com/isaacs/node-glob). `doczar` does not parse directories - you must select files.
--j, --js, --jsmod | Loads the filename with [required](https://github.com/defunctzombie/node-required) and documents every required source file.
--node             | Automatically fills the `--jsmod`, `--parse` and `--root` options for a Node.js module by reading `./package.json`.
--with             | Include a prebuilt standard library in the documentation. Standard libraries may be selected automatically when using other options (such as `--jsmod` or `--parse`) which imply a specific environment.
--parse            | [Parse](#syntax-parsing) selected files as source code using inline documentation. Mimics the more familiar behavior of javadoc-derived documentation systems.
--root             | Prefixes a path to every documented or parser-generated declaration. The root path is overridden by the first `@module` directive found in each file. The path of a `@module` tag is **never** affected by the `--root` option. The `--parse` option does not apply the root path to external dependencies.
--dev              | Display Components marked with the `@development` modifier.
--api              | Display **only** Components marked with the `@api` modifier.
--raw              | Log console events as json strings instead of pretty printing them. (`doczar` uses [Bunyan](https://github.com/trentm/node-bunyan) logging)
--json             | Create an `index.json` file in each directory instead of a rendered `index.html`.
--date             | By default, every page is marked with the (local) time it was generated. This option explicitly sets the datestamp on each page. Accepts any date/time string compatible with the common javascript Date constructor.
--jTrap, --jtrap   | Ensures that all javadoc-flavored documentation produced by the parser is contained within the parent `@module`.

Development
-----------
`doczar` is developed and maintained by Kevin "Schmidty" Smith under the MIT license. If you want to see continued development on `doczar`, please help Kevin
[pay his bills!](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_donations&business=PN6C2AZTS2FP8&lc=US&currency_code=USD&bn=PP%2dDonationsBF%3abtn_donate_SM%2egif%3aNonHosted)


Comment Syntax
--------------
### Declarations
The simplest form of documentation is a single Declaration in its own block comment with an
informational summary. The opening line of a block comment must contain only the characters opening
the comment, a Declaration and as many spaces and tabs as you want. On the next line you may begin
describing this unit of code with
[github-flavored markdown](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown/).

In languages with c-like block comments it looks like the following. Note that using exactly two
asterisks to start your comment, `/**`, will soon cause the comment to be treated as a javadoc-style
comment.
```c
/*      @class MyClass
    C-like block comments support any number of asterisks
    *immediately after the slash* however `/* ` will
    cause your comment to be read as a javadoc-style comment.
*/
/************* @member MyClass#asteriskCount
    *Any* number of asterisks other than two is fine.
*/
```

The final newline is not required.
```c
/* @module BoxFactory */
int myInt = 42; /* @local/int myInt */

/*  @spare ExtraDocs
    These extra documents are part of the
    [BoxFactory](.) module. Their full
    path is `BoxFactory~ExtraDocs`.
*/
```

A special markdown caveat: you will need *two* newlines to terminate a bullet list.
```c
/*      @property/Function doTheThings
    Does all the things. It does:
     * the hottest things
     * the coolest things
     * all the things you could ever
        possibly imagine

    And it does them fast!
*/
```

If you are using the `--parse` option you may usually ommit the leading Declaration and simply get
right into your documentation. For more information see the section on [Syntax Parsing](#syntax-parsing).
```javascript
/* How often the user will
  be able to:
   * give you up
   * let you down
   * hurt you
*/
var timesGonna = "never";
```

In python, any "triple" string literal that starts with a declaration is considered a doc comment.
```python
def referenceMontyPython (skit):
    """     @property/function referenceMontyPython
        Either triple or triple-double is fine.
    """
```

Ruby users may use `=begin` and `=end` with the same rules.
```ruby
=begin  @module MyRubyGem
    I don't know very much about Ruby.
=end
```

Finally, HTML comments are also supported.
```html
<!--    @module SplashPage
    Guest user landing page with corporate logo and account login/registration tools.
-->
```

Indentation of a markdown section is automagically normalized to the least-indented line and you may
include any number of tab and space characters before any Declaration. You can even break in the
middle of a link, like so:
```c
/*  @member/int foo
    A contracted document with
    little available horizontal
    space that needs a [link]
    (http://google.com) to a
    search engine.
*/
```

To add a child with a standalone doc comment, simply specify a
[complex path](#components-types-and-paths) of any length.
```c
/*      @class FooClass
    A simple class.
*/
/*      @property/Function FooClass.getDefault
    Get a new default instance of FooClass.
*/
/*      @returns/FooClass FooClass.getDefault)defaultInstance
    Returns a new instance with the default configuration.
*/
```


### Inner Declarations
Once you have opened a declaration, you may write additional declarations which will all be scoped
to the enclosing comment.

```c
/*      @class MyClass
    A simple class.
@property/Function getAllInstances
    A static Function that returns all instances of MyClass.
@member/Function doSomethingCool
    A member Function on each instance of MyClass.
*/
```


###Modules

The `@module` Declaration has an infectious scope. Every Declaration after it is scoped to the
module Component, as are value type paths that begin with a delimiter. See [crosslinking]
(#crosslinking) for more information. If you want to semantically declare a `@module` without
affecting the scope, use the `@submodule` declaration instead.

In some languages such as Java, the concept of a module is very specific and `@module` declarations
always describe an importable structure. In environments like Node.js where directly importing
submodules is rare, one might use a `@module` to describe a type that is involved in processing or
may be returned but which is abstract or cannot be accessed directly.

The global namespace and the first level of modules live together. Beyond the root, modules possess
their own namespace and are delimited with forward slash (`/`).
```c
/*      @module Foo
    The Foo module.
*/
/*      @class Bar
    The Foo.Bar class.
*/
/*      @submodule/class Baz
    The Foo/Baz class.
*/
/*      @property/Function createBar
    The Foo.createBar function.
*/
```


### Value Types
A value type is declared with a forward slash. Multiple value types are declared with the pipe `|`
character.
```c
/*      @property/String foobar
    A String property called "foobar".
*/
/*      @property/Number|undefined result
    This property may be either a Number or `undefined`.
*/
```


### Modifiers and Flags
Modifiers, and their simpler counterpart Flags, are statements which modify the Declaration directly
above them rather than declaring a new Component. Modifiers have serious consequences for the
visibility and position of a Component and its children. Flags simply appear in the final
documentation as keywords in a contrasting color.
```c
/*      @class MyClass
    @super LisasClass
    @public
    A simple subclass of Lisa's class.
@member/String uniqueID
    @const
    This id String is generated at instantiation and because
    it is constant, it will never give you up, never let you
    down.
*/
```

Here is a list of the available Modifiers and Flags:

#### Modifiers
 * `@development` hides this Component unless the --dev flag is used
 * `@api` reveals this Component and its ancestors when the --api flag is used
 * `@optional` indicates something which need not exist (usually an argument)
 * `@super` inherits from a superclass
 * `@implements` associates an implemented Java interface
 * `@default` describes a default value. Always use backticks.
 * `@root` causes any given Component to affect the document scope as if it were a Module.
 * `@alias` copies the documentation from another path onto this Component
 * `@patches` copies this Component's documentation into another path
 * `@remote` replaces this Component's documentation with links to an internet url
 * `@default` documents this Component's default value

#### Flags
 * `@public`
 * `@protected`
 * `@private`
 * `@abstract`
 * `@final`
 * `@volatile`
 * `@const`



Syntax Parsing
--------------
Syntax parsing is currently available for Javascript in two distinct flavors for either code used in
a browser through a `<script>` tag (including use of the ES6 `import` statement) or module-based
code as used with [node.js](https://nodejs.org/) or [browserify](http://browserify.org/). The next
platforms planned to receive parsing support are python and java.

When documenting any kind of importable module with `doczar` you will probably want to use the
`--root` flag. This flag will tell `doczar` where to mount documentation for the first files it
encounters. Files that are then pulled in by tracing dependencies will be given a generated root
path. Rather than add `@module` tags to every document, run `doczar` with `--root MyModule` to
prefix your module path onto the generated module path for each file. You may still override this
path in any given file by adding a `@module` tag. The first `@module` tag of any file is *always*
relative to the documentation root, *never* the `--root` option path.

Most parsing modes are affected by the `--locals` option. This option controls whether documentation
is generated for identifiers that are only available on their local scope. If so, these names have
the Component type `local` and use `%` as their path delimiter, e.g.
`@local MyModule.MyClass#method%localVariable`. The options are: `--locals none` (default).
`--locals comments` generates documentation for any value with a comment or at least one child
Component. `--locals all` documents all local values.

In all modes, you attach a comment to a value like this:
```javascript
/*
    The leading declaration is no longer necessary
    unless you want to override the parser.
*/
var foo = "bar";

// This comment is ignored.
// Only one leading inline comment will be used.
var bar = foo;

/* @module OverriddenName
    Rather than the parsed name (`thingy`) this [Object]()
    will be documented as a module named `OverriddenName`.

    Everything later in the same file will become a child of the `OveriddenName` module.
*/
var thingy = {
    // documented as OverriddenName.utilFunction
    utilFunction:   function (information) {
        var disinformation = spin (information);
        return disinformation;
    }
};

var movieIndex = Math.floor (
    Math.random()*NEW_MOVIES.length
); // this comment will document `movieIndex`

var trailer = NEW_MOVIES[movieIndex].trailer; /*
    This comment will document `trailer`.
*/
```

### Javascript Caveats
In order to track classes that use the `__proto__` property to build instances, this behavior is
interpereted in a slightly skewed way. Consider the following code fragment:

```javascript
function ClassConstructor (arg0, arg1) {
    this.__proto__ = {
        method1:    function(){ }
    };
}
ClassConstructor.prototype.method0 = function(){ };
```

`doczar` will document the `ClassConstructor` class as containing two members, called `method0` and
`method1`. This is because `doczar` chooses to document *every* property which *may* appear on a
type, regardless of whether it is always present.


### Parsing Modes
#### `--parse js`
The simplest javascript parsing mode. Values in the scope of each file parsed are documented as
global values. ES6 features are supported. Dependant files loaded with `import` will receive
default module paths.


#### `--parse node
Parsing with `--parse node` is somewhat less automated, requiring that some tags be defined manually
in order to anchor the documentation in the global scope.



Components, Types and Paths
---------------------------
Let's look at all the Components we have available.

#### Primary Components
These are the only Components which may be used to open a new document comment.
 * `@module` organizational Component
 * `@class` instantiable class objects
 * `@struct` c-like structures
 * `@interface` Java interface
 * `@spare` bare markdown document
 * `@property` static property
 * `@member` instance property or method
 * `@event` event descriptions
 * `@throws` conditions causing an exception to be thrown
 * `@enum` list of named values


#### Inner Components
These may only appear inside a document comment opened by a Primary Component Declaration.
 * `@argument` optionally-named function or event argument
 * `@kwarg` python-style keyword argument
 * `@callback` callback function
 * `@returns` return value
 * `@signature` an alternate function signature
 * `@named` a named value in an `@enum`.

Many of these Component types have their own special path delimiters. This lets us reference more
things as paths than in any other document generator. Here they are:

#### Special Delimiters
 * `~` `@spare`
 * `/` `@module`
 * `.` `@property`
 * `#` `@member`
 * `(` `@argument`
 * `)` `@returns`
 * `!` `@throws`
 * `+` `@event`
 * `&` `@signature`

You can use a name starting with a delimiter to imply the Component type of any Inner Declaration,
skipping directly to the value type. You may do this with any of the types listed above as an
entirely optional feature. My personal recommendation is to use it only for `@property` and
`@member`.

The default delimiter is `"."`, for `@property`.
```c
/*      @class MyClass
@Function .getAllInstances
    Load all instances of MyClass.
@Number count
    Total number of instances.
@String #uniqueID
    The unique identifier of this MyClass instance.
@Error !EnvironFailure
    Throws an Error during instantiation if the local
    environment is configured incorrectly.
@String (uniqueID
    A unique identifier to instantiate with.
*/
```

Feel free to document a type as being a pointer or array.
```c
/*      @struct Node
    A linked list node.
@member:Node* previous
    Previous Node in the chain.
@member:Node* next
    Next Node in the chain.
@member:char[] payload
    Data stored by this node in the chain.
*/
```


#### Crosslinking
You can easily crosslink to any other defined Component using the normal markdown link syntax. If
you start a crosslink path with a delimiter, the target will be rooted to the current module scope.

Furthermore, every defined Component is also a valid type, and the same rule applies when starting a
type path with a delimiter.
```c
/*      @module MyModule
    A simple module.
*/
/*      @class MyClass
    A simple class.
*/
/*      @property:Function clone
@argument:.MyClass source
    The [MyClass](.MyClass) instance to clone.
@returns:MyModule.MyClass
    The fresh [MyClass](MyModule.MyClass) instance.
*/
```



Documents and Spares
--------------------
You may Declare a Component any number of times. Child Components and documentation accumulates in
the order in which it is loaded.
```c
/*      @class MyClass
    Some information about MyClass.
*/
/*      @class MyClass
    Some (more) information about MyClass.
*/
```

Available exclusively as an Inner Declaration, `@load` allows you to pull in an external markdown
document. Because in loaded docs it's valuable to support html hash links , i.e.
`[more info](#more-info)`, it is impossible to properly support localized paths when using `@load`.
Your links will be scoped to the global namespace and any type link starting with a delimiter will
be rejected.

This example is taken directly from the `doczar` doc comments.
```c
/*      @module doczar
    Select, load and parse source files for `doczar`-format
    documentation comments. Render html output to a
    configured disk location.
@spare README
    This is the rendered output of the `doczar` source
    documentation. *View the [source]
    (https://github.com/shenanigans/node-doczar) on GitHub!*
    @load
        ./README.md
*/
```


In the first stage of rendering, the markdown document(s) on a Component are moved into new `@spare`
instances. The normal documentation appearing after a Declaration is moved to the path `~summary`.
When available, `~summary` is used when a Component is displayed on another Component's output page,
and `~details` is used on a Component's own page. If you choose to manually specify only one of
these two paths, all accumulated documentation not associated with a `@spare` will default to the
unspecified path. When both paths are specified, unassociated documentation is appended to
`~details`.

There is no limit to how many spares a Component may have, however their titles are subject to
normal namespace restrictions (sorry).
```c
/*      @class FooClass
    Basic information.
@spare details
    Detailed information.
*/
/*      @class FooClass
    More basic information.
*/
/*      @class BarClass
    Detailed information.
@spare summary
    Basic information.
*/
/*      @class BarClass
    More detailed information.
*/
```



Functions
---------
The Inner Declarations `@argument`, `@kwarg`, `@callback`, `@signature` and `@returns` are used to
describe Functions. During parsing, these Components have special scoping which is designed to help
intuitively document an entire Function in one tag. Never forget that this special scope *only*
affects these Component types *exclusively*. The scope will be immediately reset by the first
normal Declaration.

Here is a simple Function Declaration with `@argument` and `@returns` declarations. You may name
your arguments and return values, or not.
```c
/*      @property:Function doTheDew
    Do the Dew until you can't even.
@argument:Number volume
    Volume of Dew to do, in fluid ounces.
@argument:String method
    How to do the Dew.
@returns:String message
    Returns a hip phase, such as "Totally radical!!!".
*/
```

```c
/*      @property/Function sortItems
    A sorting function for Item instances.
@argument:Item
    The first Item.
@argument:Item
    The second Item.
@returns:Number
    -1, 0, or 1.
*/
```

Keyword arguments are as easy as replacing `@argument` with `@kwarg`.
```c
/*      @property:Function tellParrotJoke
    Repeat some Monty Python jokes about a parrot.
@kwarg:String parrotType
    Type of parrot to joke about.
*/
```


### Callback Functions
The `@callback` Declaration expands the `@argument` scope in order to document the callback
Function's arguments. You may reclose this scope with any unnamed `@returns` Declaration. You may
name your callbacks, or not.
```c
/*      @property:Function loadDefinitions
    Load definition file from the remote server.
@argument:String hostname
    URL of the remote server.
@callback
    @argument:Error|undefined error
        If a fatal Error prevented the file from
        being loaded properly, it is passed to
        the callback.
    @argument:Buffer|undefined definitionsFile
        The loaded definitions file, or `undefined`
        if an Error occured.
    @returns
@argument:Boolean devLogging
    @optional
    Activate development-mode logging messages.
*/
```

It is possible to document multiple `@returns` Declarations on a `@callback`. You can still close
the scope manually with a blank `@returns` Declaration.
```c
/*      @property:Function getJiggyWithIt
    Get jiggy with it.
@callback onError
    Called if a fatal Exception occured.
    @returns:function responseAction
        What to do about the Exception.
    @returns:Number priority
        How important this reaction is.
    @returns
@callback onSuccess
    Called if we got jiggy successfully.
    @argument:Number jigginessLevel
        Maximum level of jigginess achieved.
*/
```


### Function Signatures
If you're writing an overloaded function with multiple signatures or need to document special
permutations of optional arguments, `@signature` is there for you. It redefines the return value and
argument signature and documents the signature separately.

When you create a `@signature` with an Inner Declaration, the scope rules for Functions and
`@argument` Components apply.
```c
/*      @property/Function writeBuffer
    Interprets the contents of a Buffer as UTF-8
    and writes it in the sky with smoke signals.
@signature:Number (content)
    Write out the entire Buffer and return the
    number of bytes written.
@signature:Number|undefined (content, bytes)
    Write up to `bytes` bytes of text from
    `content`. If there is content remaining,
    returns the number of unwritten bytes.
@argument:Buffer content
    Text content to skywrite.
@argument:Number bytes
    Limit output to a set number of bytes.
*/
```

Signatures may be declared in their own comments.
```c
/*      @signature writeBuffer (content, bytes)
    Write up to `bytes` bytes of text from `content`.
    If there is content remaining, returns the number
    of unwritten bytes.
```

You may also define a signature with value types. These types have no additional implications, they
are only displayed in the documentation (and crosslinked).
```c
/*      @property/Function write
    Output information through the Morse telegram interface.
@argument content
    The content to send.
@signature (String content)
    Send the content as ascii text, followed by `STOP`.
@signature (Number content)
    Convert the number to ascii text and send, followed
    by `STOP`.
@signature (Array<String> content)
    Send each message, delimited and terminated with
    `STOP`.
*/
```

Signatures cannot be inherited or overridden individually.



Inheritence
-----------
To inherit static and member properties from another Component of any type, use the `@super`
modifier.
```c
/*      @class BaseClass
    A simple base class.
@Function createDefault
    Create and return a default instance.
    @returns/.BaseClass
@Function #toString
    Produce a String representation of this instance.
*/
/*      @class SubClass
    A simple subclass.
@Function #toString
    Overrides `BaseClass#toString`.
*/
```

If a Component with a superclass also has at least one value type that is exactly `"function"` or
`"Function"`, it will also inherit arguments, signatures, return values and thrown exceptions.

Java interfaces are also supported, with `@interface` and `@implements`.
```c
/*      @interface UniversalRemote
    The common interface for a universal remote control.
@member:Function volumeUp
    Increase speaker volume.
@member:Function volumeDown
    Decrease speaker volume.
*/
/*      @class Tamtung_Model042_3
    @implements .UniversalRemote
@member:Function volumeUp
    Increase speaker volume.
@member:Function volumeDown
    Decrease speaker volume.
*/
```



Events and Errors
-----------------
Document events with the `@event` declaration. Pass information with your Event by attaching
`@argument` Components.
```c
/*      @class Element
    An HTML DOM Element.
@event click
    Sent when a user presses down and releases the
    same mouse button within the bounding box of this
    Element, without exceeding the host browser's
    minimum threshold for [drag](Element+drag) events.
    Unless cancelled, this event bubbles upward and
    occurs in parent Elements until the `document` is
    reached.
    @argument/MouseEvent
        The originating mouse event.
*/
```

Cases which cause exceptions to be thrown may be documented with the simple Declaration `@throws`.
You may name your exception cases, or not.
```python
class dict:
    """     @class dict
        A hash map of Strings to untyped references.
    """
    def get (self, key):
        """     @member/function dict#get
            Retrieve a reference.
        @throws/KeyError notFound
            Failure to find a key results in an exception.
        @throws/TypeError
            If the key reference does not implement
            `__hash__`, a TypeError is raised.
        """
```



Generics
--------
Type paths support generics (java), templates (c++) and arrays-of-things (javascript). You may
specify any number of generic types on any type path, including with the use of multiple types and
pipes `|`.
```c
/*      @property/Array<String>|Object<String, String>|undefined fooProp
    An Array of Strings, an Object mapping Strings to Strings, or undefined.
*/
```

### Coming Soon
Generics in Class Declarations.
```c
/*      @class Container<Object elemType>
    A container of arbitrarily-typed references.
@function #get
    @argument/String elemName
        The name of the element to get.
    @returns/%elemType|null
        The requested element, or `null`.
*/
```



Javascript ES6
--------------
There is standard library coverage for ES6. Call `doczar` with the `--with es6` option.
Additionally, the `browser-strict` and `iojs` standard libraries will pull in ES6 documentation.

Several additional tricks were added to `doczar` itself to support the documentation of `ES6`
scripts.

### Symbols
Symbols are supported inline everywhere normal paths are supported. You may use either absolute or
locally rooted paths in Symbols.
```c
/*      @module MainPackage */

/*      @class FooList
    An Iterable collection of Foos.
@member:Function [Symbol.iterator]
    Create an [Iterator]() that lists all our Foos.
@property:Symbol staticSymbol
    A Symbol stored statically on the FooList class.
*/

/*      @member/String FooList#[.FooList.staticSymbol]
    A String stored on FooList instances, mapped to a
    static symbol.
*/
```

```c
/*      @class Foo
    @root
@property:Symbol alfa
    A static Symbol mapped to a String.
@property:Symbol [.alfa]
    A static Symbol mapped to a static Symbol.
@property:Symbol [.[.alfa]]
    Another static Symbol mapped to a static Symbol.
@member:String [.[.[.alfa]]]
    A String mapped to a static Symbol.
*/
```

### Rest and Spread
To document use of the `rest` keyword or "spread" syntax to accept arbitrary numbers of arguments,
use the `@args` declaration.
```c
/*      @member:Function Foo#methodAlfa
    A method that takes at least one argument.
@argument:String firstArgument
    The first, mandatory argument.
@args:Number restArguments
    An arbitrary number of additional arguments.
*/
```
